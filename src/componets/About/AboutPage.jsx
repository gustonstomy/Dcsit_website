      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        For more than 25 years, computing courses have been provided for students from various departments by the computer centre.
        With the recent developments and trends in the information technology (IT), the University of Cape Coast established an academic department known as the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary focus of this department is teaching and research in computing. Furthermore, the need for trained computer scientists and information technologists is one of the challenges that face the rapidly growing Ghanaian economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The worldwide shortage of qualified human resources in IT has been the main obstacle to the deployment, exploitation and development of ICT to accelerate socio-economic development. In Ghana there is an urgent need to meet this shortfall in computer science with graduates having the requisite skills.
      </p>

        This programme is geared toward this major area of manpower requirement by preparing qualified SSS graduate for a career in IT.

        The programmes that the DCSIT runs are geared towards this major area of manpower requirement. In this regard, the department admits qualified SSS graduates and train them for a career in computing. The Department offers three programs: BSc Computer Science, BSc Information Technology and a PhD in Computer Science and Application. These programs provide a comprehensive education in both theoretical and practical aspects of Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a variety of exciting courses, including software engineering, artificial intelligence, internet systems and technology, computer security, algorithms, data structures, programming languages, operating systems hardware development, databases, networks design, business management and practices, as well cryptography, Data mining, Optimization as some of our doctoral studies in computing-related fields.
      </p>
